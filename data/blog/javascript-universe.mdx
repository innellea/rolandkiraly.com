# In the beginning was the value

#### What is a value? It’s hard to say.

A value is a fundamental concept in JavaScript—so we can’t
define it through other terms.

Numbers and strings are values. Objects and functions are values, too

There are also a lot of things that are not values, like the pieces of
our code—our if statements, loops, and variable declarations, for
example.

# Values

<Image src='/static/images/blog/js-universe/values.png' width={1000 / 2} height={1126 / 2} />

Broadly, there are two kinds of values.

## - Primitive Values

All primitive values have something in common: ** They are a permanent part of our JavaScript
universe. I can point to them, but I can’t create, destroy, or change them**.

To see primitive values in practice, open your browser’s console
and log them:

```js
console.log(2);
console.log('hello');
console.log(undefined);
```

## - Objects and Functions

Objects and functions are also values but, unlike primitive
values, **I can manipulate them from my code**.

Go ahead and log a few of them to the browser console:

```js
console.log({});
console.log([]);
console.log(x => x * 2);
```

Notice how the browser console displays them _differently_ from
primitive values. Some browsers might display an arrow before
them, or do something special when you click them. If you have a
few different browsers installed, compare how they visualize
objects and functions

**_Fun Fact_** <br/>
_Functions are objects, but because they include a few unique
additional features, we’re going to refer to them separately to avoid
confusion_

# Types of Values

At first, all values in the JavaScript might look the same—
just bright dots in the sky.
But we are here to study all of the different things floating above us in our JavaScript universe, so we’ll need a way to categorize them.
We can break values down into types — values of the same type
behave in similar ways.
As an aspiring astronomer, you might want
to know about every type of value that can be observed in the
JavaScript sky.
After almost twenty-five years of studying JavaScript, the scientists
have only discovered nine such types:

## - Primitive Values

- Undefined ([undefined](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined)), used for unintentionally missing values.
- Null ([null](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/null)), used for intentionally missing values.
- Booleans ([true and false](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/boolean)), used for logical operations.
- Numbers ([-100, 3.14, and others](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/number)), used for math calculations.
- BigInts ([uncommon and new](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/bigint)), used for math on big numbers.
- Strings (["hello", "abracadabra", and others](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/string)), used for text.
- Symbols ([uncommon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/symbol)), used to perform rituals and hide secrets.

## - Objects and Functions

- Objects ([{} and others](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object)), used to group related data and code.
- Functions ([x => x \* 2 and others](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function)), used to refer to code.

## - No Other Types

You might ask: “But what about other types I have used, like
arrays?”

In JavaScript, there are no other fundamental value types
other than the ones we have just enumerated.
The rest are all
objects! For example, even [arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), [dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), and [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)
fundamentally are objects in JavaScript:

```js
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof new Date());
console.log(typeof /(hello|goodbye)/);
```

# Checking a Type

There are only nine types of values, but how do we know a
particular value’s type?

<Image src='/static/images/blog/js-universe/typeof.png' width={825 / 2} height={1289 / 2} />

If we want to check a value’s type, we can ask with the typeof
operator. Below are a few examples you can try in the browser
console:

```js
console.log(typeof 2);
console.log(typeof 'hello');
console.log(typeof undefined);
```

Strictly speaking, using parens isn’t required with typeof. For
example, `typeof 2` would work just as fine as `typeof(2)`.

However, sometimes parens are required to avoid an ambiguity.
One of the cases below would break if we omitted the parens after
typeof. Try to guess which one it is:

```js
console.log(typeof {});
console.log(typeof []);
console.log(typeof (x => x * 2));
```

You can verify your guess in the browser console.
You might have questions. Good. If you ask a question, our
JavaScript universe might answer it! Provided, of course, that you
know how to ask.

# Expressions

There are many questions JavaScript can’t answer.
But there are some questions that JavaScript would be delighted
to answer. These questions have a special name—they are called
[expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators).

If we “ask” the expression `2 + 2`, JavaScript will “answer” with the
value `4`.

For another example, remember how we determined the type of a
value with `typeof`. In fact, that was also an expression! Our
“question” was `typeof(2)` and the JavaScript universe answered
it with the string value `"number"`.
Expressions are questions that JavaScript can answer.
JavaScript answers expressions in the only way it knows
how—with values.
If the word “expression” confuses you, think of it as a piece of code
that expresses a value. You might hear people say that 2 + 2
“results in” or “evaluates to” 4. These are all different ways to say
the same thing.
We ask JavaScript 2 + 2, and it answers with 4. Expressions
always result in a single value. Now we know enough about
expressions to be dangerous!

# Recap

### Let’s recap what we know so far:

- There are values, and then there’s code. We can think of values
  as different things “floating” in our JavaScript universe. They don’t
  exist inside our code, but we can refer to them from our code.
- There are two categories of values: there are Primitive Values,
  and then there are Objects and Functions. In total, there are
  nine separate types. Each type serves a specific purpose, but
  some are rarely used.
- Some values are lonely. For example, null is the only value of
  the Null type, and undefined is the only value of the Undefined
  type. As we will learn later, these two lonely values are quite the
  troublemakers!

- We can ask questions with expressions. Expressions exist in
  our code, so they are not values. Rather, JavaScript will answer
  our expressions with values. For example, the 2 + 2 expression
  is answered with the value 4.
- We can inspect the type of something by wrapping it in a
  typeof expression. For example, typeof(4) results in the
  string value "number"
